Title: Down-and-in put option price
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Joanna Ceglinska
Maintainer: Joanna Ceglinska <ceglinska.joanna@gmail.com>
Description: The package calculates the theoretical price of down-and-in put option (using Monte Carlo simulation). 
    The algorithm generates a number of price paths defined by user. For each path, if the minimum price 
    is below the barrier price, the payoff is equal to vanilla put option, else the payoff is zero.
